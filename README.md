# Run Stryker GitHub Action

This action runs [Stryker.NET](https://stryker-mutator.io/docs/stryker-net/introduction/) on your specified test project.

## Inputs

### `testProject`

**Required** The path to the directory of the test project that needs to be tested by Stryker. No default.

### `breakAt`

**Optional** Set the minimal mutation score threshold for the action to succeed. If the threshold is not met, the action will fail the pipeline. The default value is `0`. 

## Outputs
